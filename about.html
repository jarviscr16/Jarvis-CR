  <h2>About the Coach</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">
    My journey wasn’t pay-to-win. It was learning, quitting, returning, and pushing through.

      <h3>2020 — The Start</h3>
      <p>
        I started playing Clash Royale during COVID online classes.  
        Me and my brother shared one account, playing one match each.

      <h3>2021 — My Own Account</h3>
      <p>
        As my interest grew, I created my own account and began learning the game seriously.

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>The Burnout</h3>
      <p>
        I slowly understood the mechanics, but got frustrated by pay-to-win players and quit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>The Comeback</h3>
      <p>
        Around 1.5 years ago, I returned with a fresh mindset — focusing on fundamentals.

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>2025 — The Push</h3>
      <p>
        I hit <strong>10K trophies in August 2025</strong>, quickly climbed to <strong>15K</strong>,
        and reached <strong>Champion</strong> in the following season.

    <div class="timeline-item highlight">
      <h3>Why I Coach Now</h3>
      <p>
        I coach players between <strong>0–10K trophies</strong> who are stuck where I once was —
        confused, tilted, and overwhelmed.
        <br><br>
        No shortcuts. Just understanding the game.
